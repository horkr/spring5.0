/**
 * This is the central interface in Spring's transaction infrastructure.
 * Applications can use this directly, but it is not primarily meant as API:
 * Typically, applications will work with either TransactionTemplate or
 * declarative transaction demarcation through AOP.
 *
 * <p>For implementors, it is recommended to derive from the provided
 * {@link org.springframework.transaction.support.AbstractPlatformTransactionManager}
 * class, which pre-implements the defined propagation behavior and takes care
 * of transaction synchronization handling. Subclasses have to implement
 * template methods for specific states of the underlying transaction,
 * for example: begin, suspend, resume, commit.
 *
 * <p>The default implementations of this strategy interface are
 * {@link org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager} and
 * {@link org.springframework.jdbc.datasource.DataSourceTransactionManager},
 * which can serve as an implementation guide for other transaction strategies.
